# Basketball Performance Analysis - README

## Overview
This repository contains multiple Jupyter notebooks designed to analyze basketball performance metrics for Waterloo and Carleton teams. The analysis focuses on shooting efficiency, turnover rates, free throw performance, and shot allocation optimization.

## Notebooks and Their Purpose
### 1. Waterloo FGA.ipynb
- Analyzes **Field Goal Attempts (FGA)** for Waterloo players.
- Computes **average FGA per player** and total **team FGA per game**.
- Visualizes player shooting trends using **Seaborn bar plots**.

### 2. Team Four Factors.ipynb
- Evaluates **Four Factors** (eFG%, TOV%, ORB%, FTF%) for team performance.
- Uses **Matplotlib and Seaborn** to create bar plots for each key metric.
- Compares team efficiency across different opponents.

### 3. jj.ipynb
- Likely a supplementary notebook (requires review for specifics).
- Potentially contains additional game-by-game or player-specific analyses.

### 4. Waterloo Players 3 Factors.ipynb
- Analyzes **Three Key Factors**: eFG%, Turnover %, Free Throw Factor.
- Filters data by opponent and generates comparative bar charts.
- Helps assess individual and team-level shooting efficiency.

### 5. Carleton Team Stats 23-24.ipynb
- Loads Carleton player statistics and analyzes **Field Goal Attempts**.
- Computes **average FGA and eFG%** for each player.
- Uses **dual-axis plots** to compare shot attempts and shooting efficiency.
- Provides insights into shot distribution and optimization for future games.


## Key Insights
- **Waterlooâ€™s shot allocation optimization** ensures a total of **65 FGAs per game**.
- **Four Factors analysis** identifies team strengths and weaknesses against different opponents.
- **Shooting efficiency visualizations** highlight individual player contributions and trends.

## Future Improvements
- Automate opponent selection for comparative analysis.
- Implement interactive visualizations using Plotly.
- Expand analysis to include defensive metrics.
